# HtmxRustPriceWidget

## Overview

**HtmxRustPriceWidget** is a specialized widget designed to be integrated into larger financial projects. It serves as a self-contained module for generating buy/sell tables based on various algorithms. Written in Rust, it combines the power of multiple libraries to provide a comprehensive solution for both backend logic and frontend display.

## Features

- Generate buy/sell tables with customized parameters.
- Outputs data in multiple formats: Database, JSON, and PrettyTable.
- Built-in web server for interacting with the widget.
- Actix-based backend serving HTML templates.
  
## Dependencies

The project relies on several Rust crates, as specified in `Cargo.toml`. Some of the main ones include:

- `actix-web` for the web framework.
- `serde` for serialization and deserialization.
- `mysql` for database interactions.
- `prettytable` for displaying tables in the console.
- `tera` for template rendering.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the binaries**: Run `chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh` to compile the project.
2. **Start the Web Server**: Execute the compiled web server binary to start the Actix web server.  

        cd frontend && ./webserver

3. **Access the Widget**: Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5242`.

## Contribution and Integration
